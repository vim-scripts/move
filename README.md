# move

It's annoying to delete and yank parts of a text just to move it up and down a
bit. There is the `:m[ove]` command but it is quite awkward to use nowadays.
vim-move is a Vim plugin that moves lines and selections in a more visual
manner. See [this](http://i.imgur.com/gIw2CCD.gif) short demo for a first
impression.
